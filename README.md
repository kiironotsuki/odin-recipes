# Recipe Website

This project is a basic recipe website built as part of the curriculum for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

The website aims to provide a collection of recipes, allowing users to explore and try out different dishes. The design of the website follows a minimalistic style, embracing a brutalist web design approach.

## Features

- **Main Index Page**: The main index page serves as the landing page for the website. It provides links to a few recipes, allowing users to navigate to specific recipe pages.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe has its own dedicated page, which provides detailed instructions and ingredients for preparing the dish. Users can access these pages by clicking on the links provided on the main index page.
- **Brutalist Web Design**: The website's design follows the principles of brutalist web design, embracing a raw and unpolished aesthetic that prioritizes functionality over aesthetics.
